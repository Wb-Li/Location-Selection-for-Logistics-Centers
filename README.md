# Location selection for logistics centers with capacity constraints


Traditional logistics facility location problems focus solely on costs. However, it's crucial to recognize that logistics centers can't offer services without constraints. Hence, understanding the correlation between a logistics center's capacity and its construction costs becomes essential. Particularly during pivotal moments, prioritizing meeting freight demands takes precedence over mere cost reduction.

For instance, during China's "Double Eleven" period, there's a substantial surge in demand. The ability to provide timely services not only impacts the credibility and long-term interests of logistics companies but also underscores the importance of relinquishing some profit to deliver superior services. Effectively managing orders during such peak times significantly boosts a logistics company's competitive edge within the industry.

Also, solving the p-median problem is an NP-hard task, meaning that even for small instances, finding an exact solution is challenging. Therefore, heuristic or approximation algorithms may be necessary to discover a good, though not necessarily optimal, solution to the p-median problem. I also attempt to utilize a greedy algorithm, continuously seeking local optimal solutions to approximate the global optimum.
